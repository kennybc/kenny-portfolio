            on KhanAcademy. I started a freelance career at age 13; I had my
            parents create a freelancer.com account so I could receive my first
            payout.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's through these past projects that I've learned how to program on
            my own. I've cherrypicked some of my favorites (in no particular
            order) that I find notable or fun/interesting.

          <p>
            A blog created from scratch with a PHP backend. This was one of my
            first projects where I felt fully in control of the design decisions
            and had freedom to experiment and grow. Deepened my interest in the
            arts.

          <p>
            Featured a user account system with robust web security features. A
            very educational project for understanding the structure of a
            full-stack project and designing with OOP principles.
          </p>
          <h3>WriterJS</h3>
          <p>
            A custom WYSIWYG text editor JS library created for MotorDebate as
            part of my highly customized vision.
          </p>
          <div id="demo-1">
            <b>demo</b>
            <div id="demo-2"></div>
          </div>
          <p>
            Built for block-based editing which allows for easy componentization
            of the text: perfect for articles and blog posts.
          </p>
          <h3>Minecraft</h3>
          <p>
            In high school, I discovered a way to download Minecraft Education
            onto the school laptops. This mode didn't allow plugins or modded
            gameplay.
          </p>
          <p>
            I created a popular school-wide skyblock server with only command
            blocks (included in vanilla MC) through very niche manipulation of
            JSON-adjacent data and some research into the command block
            scripting language.

          <h3>NFT Escrow</h3>
          <p>
            A smart contract that acts as a middleman for Ethereum-based
            (primarily NFT) transactions. Lots of time spent here researching
            the complex and poorly documented smart contract standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Great practice as I was immersed in a new unfamiliar environment and
            had to do a lot of self-teaching and research.
