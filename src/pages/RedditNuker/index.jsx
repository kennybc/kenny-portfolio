          <p>
            Reddit doesn't allow bulk actions for posts/comments. People want to
            wipe their account and have to delete one by one, manually, or pay
            for a service to do it automatically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reddit has a free API with functionality including artifact
            retrieval and deletion, which allows for a pretty simple solution.
          </p>

          <p>
            Reddit Nuker uses OAuth2 to authenticate users. Permission is needed
            from the user to make calls to the Reddit API on their behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reddit Nuker only requests the minimum permission levels necessary
            to maintain functionality. Authenticated sessions are temporary and
            expire after 1 hour.
          </p>
